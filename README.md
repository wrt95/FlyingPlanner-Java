# Flying Planner

This is the 2nd Coursework for F28DA Data Structures & Algorithms, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is a program implements a Flying Planner which uses a graph library to represent airline data, and which supports searching. This is my version of it.

The source code for this program has been encrypted in FlyingPlanner.zip due to the coursework being still used. 

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested from wrt_95@hotmail.com.
